```js
// The 'unfoldr' function is a \`dual\' to 'foldr': while 'foldr'
// reduces a list to a summary value, 'unfoldr' builds a list from
// a seed value.  The function takes the element and returns 'Nothing'
// if it is done producing the list or returns 'Just' @(a,b)@, in which
// case, @a@ is a prepended to the list and @b@ is used as the next
// element in a recursive call.
//
// unfoldr(b => b === 0 ? Nothing() : Just(Tuple(b, b - 1)), 10);
// --> [10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]

// (x => Maybe [value, remainder] -> initial value -> values
