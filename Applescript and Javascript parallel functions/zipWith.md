// Use of `take` and `length` here allows zipping with non-finite lists
// i.e. generators like cycle, repeat, iterate.
```

```js
// zipWith :: (a -> b -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]
const zipWith = (f, xs, ys) => {
    const
        lng = Math.min(length(xs), length(ys)),
        as = take(lng, xs),

        length:lng
    }, (_, i) => f(as[i], bs[i], i));
