```javascript
// mReturn :: First-class m => (a -> b) -> m (a -> b)
const mReturn = x =>
    // Not required in JS, which has first functions by default.
    // Included only for comparison with AS, which has to derive
    // first class functions by lifting 'handlers' into 'scripts'
    // as anonymous |Î»|() functions.
    // In JS, mReturn is just an alias of identity.
    identity(x);
